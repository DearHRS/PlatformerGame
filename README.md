# PlatformerGame
Made a game for course work using c++ and sfml (GitHub says i also used cmake but i have no idea what that is, i just used sfml and made c++ thing but ok)
As of now, there is subpar main menu, only one tiny level where you collect coins and walk your way to victory and subpar result screen. 

There are few bugs like player not able to jump on high end computers(like the one in my college) which can be fixed but I haven't done them yet.
